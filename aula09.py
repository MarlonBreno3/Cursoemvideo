print('''Archaeologists sifting these 3000-year-old ruins know little 
 about the mysterious people who made such sophisticated art. A few clues only deepen the enigma 
 of Sanxingdui: Many of the 13,000 artifacts unearthed so far were intentionally torched and buried at a single ritual
 event. Some experts believe the treasures are sacred objects yanked from the temples of a sprawling city-state and dest
 royed as a
 final goodbye to unreliable gods after a natural cataclysm—perhaps an earthquake or flood. All signs of Sanxingdui vani
 shed soon thereafter. A few similar bronzes, excavated at a smaller site 
 30 miles away, were likely carried by refugees escaping a collapsed Sanxingdui.
 “What we are seeing in Sanxingdui are probably sacrificial pits,” says Zhao Hao, an archaeologist from Peking Universit
 
 . “Everything was stacked and buried very carefully. It was all organized. So it doesn’t appear to indicate destruction
  by war or internal 
 conflict.''')
